// To do:

// complete a walkbook and inspect the close/leave open dialogue.  Compare Android and iOS & add to elements file.

// file a bug - walkbook list ordering is different in Android - not ordered ascending by Walkbook number.

// test running current tests on iOS and Android - make compatible

// Break up tests - like Mike's

// test running with run.js -- update file



// idea: what about this?

		Retrieve an element avoiding not found exception and returning null instead:
		elementOrNull(using, value, cb) -> cb(err, element)
		TRY THIS IN fullLogin instead of the nested functions to check if rememberMe is checked.

//longer term:
	// For areas where we have to differentiate between Android and iOS:
		instead of building logic into the tests, simply keep two elements files.  They will be the same except in certain cases.

	// Split up tests, then create separate files like Mike's.





 
// Miscelaneous

	// try these for finding elements by a part of their id:

	  .elementByXPath( '//*[(contains(id()\'prim_btnRemaining\')],600000)
	  .elementByXPath( '//*[ contains( @id, \'cellHouse_8\' ) ]' )
	  .elementByXPath( '//*[ contains( @text, \'cellHouse_8\' ) ]' )
	  .elementByXPath( '//*[ contains( @checked, \'false\' ) ]' )

	// wait for an element by one of two things:
	  .waitForElementByXPath( '//UIAApplication[1]/UIAWindow[1]/UIAElement[2] | //*[ @text=\'View Later\' ]', 600000 )


	// Might try this at some point -
		'sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/xCode7.3.1/Xcode.app'
	to switch to previous version of XCode.  However, don't know if this will work with the new app.
